# Documenting Restify with Swagger

Inspired by [a Scotch.io tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/document-your-already-existing-apis-with-swagger).

We'll start with an existing RESTful API that manages League of Legends Champions. We'll use Swagger to first document the existing API and second to provide some sweet UI tools to view our API.
